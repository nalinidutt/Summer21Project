"Exploitation in scientific spaces is often an open secret, which is perhaps why one group of research assistants collectively referred to their lab as “the slave pits.” While the nickname is jarring and the comparison inappropriate, they referred to it as such because in this lab, undergraduate RAs were required to perform a minimum of 10 hours of unpaid, menial work every week for the entire semester, mostly consisting of rote data entry. RAs rarely had the opportunity to learn the craft of research through meaningful participation in its design or execution, and as you would expect from a place with such a nickname, it was not a friendly or inclusive place to work. Why, then, would so many students spend over a hundred hours working in such a place? Because RAs who tolerated this exploitation received a coveted letter of recommendation signed by a well-known faculty member (but ","Poorly Run Labs Are a Threat to Behavioral Science, But Democratic Principles Offer a Way Forward"

"My first election voting by mail was very nearly my first
election not voting at all. Ahead of a lengthy trip overseas in fall of 2018, I
requested an absentee ballot for the November midterm election, breaking a
streak of in-person voting that began in my elementary school cafeteria back in
2008. Voting in person was habitual. Voting by mail was not, so I took careful
steps to make sure that my vote would be counted. After receiving my ballot and
marking my choices, I signed where requested, sealed the envelope securely, and
made a special trip to the post office to buy the necessary return postage. I
even pinned my completed ballot to the refrigerator the day before my
departure, creating a visible reminder to drop it in the mailbox before
leaving. But habit overcame my best efforts: on my way to the airport the next
day I came to the unhappy realization that I had forgotten my ballot in the

reduced the city to rubble and ash. The first wave of devastation came in the
form of an 8.5-magnitude earthquake, the largest to have ever hit a major
European city. In the second wave, a great fire, caused by all the overturned
candles, which had been lit in observance of the religious festival, devoured
thousands of homes and other buildings. Finally, the smoldering city was
inundated by a trio of tidal waves more than sixty feet high that the
earthquake had pushed up from the ocean floor. All told, forty thousand of
