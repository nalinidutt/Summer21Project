The novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, is a global pandemic\nthat is and will continue to test us locally, nationally, and internationally\non many levels. In what is a fast-moving situation, policymakers are forced to\nmake high-stakes decisions under enormous pressure. In order to have the best\nshot at getting things right, those decisions must be informed by science wherever\npossible.", "finalSummary": "Is behavioural fatigue a sound reason for delaying social distancing?While we appreciate that the concept of behavioural fatigue may well be relevant and something to take into consideration when designing public health policies for dealing with COVID-19, we are concerned, as behavioural scientists, about the lack of evidence directly bearing on this issue.To the best of our knowledge, there is no sound evidence base to suggest that behavioural fatigue would undermine early interventions based on social distancing, and especially not in a case like the one we currently face."},

Boys, researchers found, dominated park areas like\nbasketball courts and playground equipment. Girls might pass through but\ndidn\u2019t stop to play.", "finalSummary": "This also means, as urbanist , the practice of urban planning and design and its outcomes are not gender neutral.As designers, it\u2019s important for us to think about who we represent and how, and rely more on representation and engagement to ensure good intentions don\u2019t lead to further stereotyping or tokenizing, undermining the success of interventions meant to make vulnerable groups visible.Designers who want to create spaces for women are often motivated to keep them safe, sometimes through crime-prevention design strategies, or by making women\u2019s typical patterns of movement and use of the city more convenient."},
