David Orenstein,4-Oct-18,"People sometimes mistakenly think of general anesthesia as just a really deep sleep, but in fact, anesthesia is really four brain states — unconsciousness, amnesia, immobility, and suppression of the body’s damage sensing response, or “nociception.” In a new paper in MIT neuroscientist and statistician Emery N. Brown and his colleagues argue that by putting nociception at the top of the priority list and taking a principled neuroscientific approach to choosing which drugs to administer, anesthesiologists can use far less medication overall, producing substantial benefits for patients.“We’ve come up with strategies that allow us to dose the same drugs that are generally used but in different proportions that allow us to achieve an anesthetic state that is much more desirable,” says Brown, the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Computational Neuroscience and Health Sciences and Technology in the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT and a practicing anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.In the paper Brown and co-authors lay out exactly how and where each major anesthetic drug affects the nociceptive circuits of the nervous system.Because reduced arousal is a byproduct of the strategy, they also didn’t have to administer much medicine to ensure unconsciousness, a state they scrupulously monitor in the operating room by watching brainwaves captured by electroencephalography (EEG).“If you do it this way, you have better control of nociception and you can get the same amount of unconsciousness with less drug,” says Brown, who is also associate director of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and a professor in MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and at Harvard Medical School.","A principled approach can lead to less need for drugs, especially opioids, Emery Brown and colleagues say.","To improve anesthesia, focus on neuroscience and nociception, experts urge"

Helen Knight,8-Apr-19,"Natural gas and biogas have become increasingly popular sources of energy throughout the world in recent years, thanks to their cleaner and more efficient combustion process when compared to coal and oil.However, the presence of contaminants such as carbon dioxide within the gas means it must first be purified before it can be burnt as fuel.Traditional processes to purify natural gas typically involve the use of toxic solvents and are extremely energy-intensive.As a result, researchers have been investigating the use of membranes as a way to remove impurities from natural gas in a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly way, but finding a polymer material that can separate gases quickly and effectively has so far proven a challenge.Now, in a paper published today in the journal , researchers at MIT describe a new type of polymer membrane that can dramatically improve the efficiency of natural gas purification while reducing its environmental impact.The membrane, which has been designed by an interdisciplinary research team at MIT, is capable of processing natural gas much more quickly than conventional materials, according to lead author Yuan He, a graduate student in the Department of Chemistry at MIT.“Our design can process a lot more natural gas — removing a lot more carbon dioxide — in a shorter amount of time,” He says.Existing membranes are typically made using linear strands of polymer, says Zachary Smith, the Joseph R. Mares Career Development Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT, who led this research effort.“These are long-chain polymers, which look like cooked spaghetti noodles at a molecular level,” he says.“Further, these polymers exhibit little undesired plasticization as the gas pressure is increased, despite their relatively flexible backbone, making them desired materials for carbon dioxide-related separations.”The researchers are now planning to carry out a systematic study of the chemistry and structure of the brushes, to investigate how this affects their performance, He says.“We are looking for the most effective chemistry and structure for helping the separation process.”The team are also hoping to investigate the use of their membrane designs in other applications, including carbon capture and storage, and even in separating liquids.","Novel membrane material removes more impurities, without the need for toxic solvents.","Greener, more efficient natural gas filtration"

Chandler,13-Mar-15,"“It’s an issue I care a lot about,” he said, “how we’re actually going to change the world through what we do here.”Ruiz pointed out that the campus already faces the need to carry out about $2 billion worth of renovations on its existing buildings over the next five to 10 years, but that need also presents a great opportunity for improving the overall energy efficiency of the campus.In addition, he said, MIT has “a lot of great research where we can use the campus for experiments,” and potentially find innovations that other institutions can emulate.Introducing the event, Christoph Reinhart, a professor of architecture, said the idea was to “seek broad input and see how MIT can respond” to the challenge of climate change, “and what we can do as a community” to address our own energy usage.Though that’s a minuscule footprint by global standards, how MIT manages its own facilities could have a disproportionate impact, he said: “We see ourselves as a catalyst for change, and there are a lot of people in the world looking at what we do.” If the Institute can find solutions on campus that are scalable and replicable, he said, “we can have an influence.”Henry “Jake” Jacoby, professor emeritus of management, underscored that point, saying “MIT is really small, but in terms of demonstrating what can be done, it’s really important.” He suggested that one critical step would be to change the way accounting is done so that different departments and labs would explicitly have to account for their energy use in their own budgets, giving them a direct incentive to find more efficient approaches.It’s essential, Jacoby added, given MIT’s reputation in the world, that “we don’t do things that are symbolic but don’t have a real effect.” It’s important to “not just do it, but do it right.”In moving toward innovative solutions, one key aspect for a data-driven place like MIT is to improve the ability to collect detailed energy use data at a building-by-building level or better, and that process is already well underway, said Sarah Bylinsky, a program manager in the sustainability office.",MIT Climate Change Conversation gets underway with brainstorming session on how to catalyze change.,How can MIT be a game-changer on climate?

Nancy W. Stauffer,13-Jun-18,"Guided by their computer models, Cohn and Bromberg took a series of steps to increase the power and efficiency of that design without sacrificing its emissions benefits.During normal gasoline SI engine operation, the process of translating the combustion of gases into torque (rotational force) at the wheels progresses smoothly — until there’s a need for high-torque operation, for example, to pull a heavy load at high speed or up a hill.The SI engine doesn’t contain all the excess air that’s in a diesel, so the total volume of its cylinders can be smaller.“Because of that difference, you can replace a diesel engine with an SI engine about half as big,” says Bromberg.With that reduction in size comes an increase in fuel efficiency.",Gasoline-alcohol engines for heavy-duty trucks could produce a meaningful improvement in global air quality.,Getting the world off dirty diesels
